# AC-Cascade-Sim
A MATLAB-based simulator of cascades in power grids

random_edge_cascading_fail_AC simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow under shedding and curtailing balancing rule (Cascade Process I)

random_edge_cascading_fail_AC_inertia simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow  under seperating and adjusting balancing rule (Cascade Process II)

random_edge_cascading_fail_AC_fuzzy simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow unde probablistic line outage rules (Cascade Process III)
