# AC-Cascade-Sim
A MATLAB-based simulator of cascades in power grids
random_edge_cascading_fail_AC simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow (Cascade Process I)
random_edge_cascading_fail_AC_inertia simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow (Cascade Process II)
random_edge_cascading_fail_AC_fuzzy simulates  cascading failure scenario of link failures with AC load flow (Cascade Process III)
